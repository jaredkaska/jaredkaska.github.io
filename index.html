            Hi, my name is Jared, and I'm a network technician. I currently work for a casino, managing and documenting the whole network there, but I previously worked for an internet service provider doing everything from residential installs to commercial infrastructure construction.

            This website exists because I owned the domain and felt that I should probably have something on it. I'm not a web developer by any means, but I can whip up enough HTML to make this functional. I made this whole thing in one night when I have work in the morning.

            Check out the Blog page to read about whatever's on my mind or what I'm doing. Tools is where I have some basic tools that I like to use (and maybe you will too!). Finally, if you'd like to reach out, I also have a Contact page.

            Thanks for stopping by.
