            <p>Hi, I'm Jared. I'm a 24-year-old Network Technician located in the Seattle area, currently working 
                at a casino. I spend my days documenting, planning, configuring, building, and managing a large-scale network 
                and making cool stuff in my free time. Welcome to my website, where I share some of the stuff that I do, 
                as well as host some tools for myself, or whoever would like to use them.</p>
            <p>I'm not a web developer by any means, if that wasn't obvious. I know enough HTML and CSS to make this website 
                not completely painful to the eyes, and that's about it. The little bit of actual programming I do is mostly 
                API stuff in Python to make my network documentation go by a little smoother. I am, however, constantly 
                learning and trying to improve my skills. If you'd like to read more about what I'm currently up to, head 
                over to the Blog page and see the stuff that I've done.
            </p>
            <p>And if you're looking to reach out, go ahead and contact me on the Contact page above.</p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
