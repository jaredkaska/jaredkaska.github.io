                    I'm quite a few months into my job as a "Network Technician" (although I like to call myself a Network Administrator to sound better), and I think I'm really getting the hang of things. When I first started in this role, I was definitely feeling the imposter syndrome setting in, as I had never had such a specialized job before, and had no formal education on networking. Despite that, I think I've really gotten into a groove of things and picked up what I need to know rather quickly. That being said, I'm always learning new things and improving what I do to make the network operate more smoothly and securely.<div><br></div><div>One great challenge of mine has been learning the wonderful world of NAC - specifically FortiNAC. When I was a simple uninformed user of the internet, I found it kinda fascinating how hotels and businesses would have this login portal, with segmentation and security and all that. Now, I have discovered that that's due to NAC, or Network Access Control.</div><div><br></div><div>I knew this would be a <i>part </i>of my job, but I didn't realize just how much time I'd really be spending working in FortiNAC. You see, when I got this position, we were basically halfway through getting NAC deployed throughout the network. We had one NAC-enabled wifi network that maybe half of the devices used, and about a dozen NAC-enabled switches sprinkled around. It was a little chaotic.</div><div><br></div><div>So, naturally, one of my big projects was to complete this rollout of FortiNAC and make the network this wonderful dynamic utopia where I never had to manually update ports, and Helpdesk could plug stuff in all willy-nilly. When working in a 24-hour business with thousands of devices and literally over 100 different VLANs for all types of devices you could ever think of, that's easier said than done.</div><div><br></div><div>To add insult to injury, before me, basically nothing was documented. There's hundreds of devices that I have no idea what they are. There's hundreds of cables that disappear into the walls, never to find their other end. There's weird one-off HVAC devices connected to one switch. There's entire wifi networks dedicated to one stubborn device that can't figure out 2.4 vs 5 GHz in 2025. It's one-part absolute never-ending nightmare, and two-parts fun scavenger hunt.</div><div><br></div><div>And you know what, I bet FortiNAC works super well... when you use Fortinet switches and access points. Unfortunately for us, we don't, and that's just the cherry on top. Don't get me wrong, we have a site that's fully Fortinet-deployed, and I would never want that for my main site. I love my Aruba switches and Juniper Mist APs. I just wish FortiNAC would play ball with them a little better. I still haven't figured out how to make the access points dynamic, because as much as the switch sees their real MAC in its address table, FortiNAC just refuses to, and when it does, it shows all the devices connected to the AP as well, and I haven't yet figured out how to make the AP take priority so who knows what VLAN that port would get set to if I enabled NAC on it.</div><div><br></div><div>I think this is what real developers refer to as "implementation hell."</div><div><br></div><div>When it works, though, it's beautiful. For devices that aren't stubborn and awful, being able to just set its profile once and then it works everywhere automagically is incredible. Better yet, some devices auto-register so I don't even have to know it exists for it to just work. The dynamic VLAN switching of wireless devices is also awesome, being able to have one big wifi network with no password where everything is still segmented and secure is such a blessing.</div><div><br></div><div>I think we're still trying to get the hang of it and figure out all the features and best practices for what we do. There's an immense learning curve with NAC and you will mess up at some point and knock a whole group of devices across the entire site offline. Or you'll just start getting random failed authentications and have no idea what step along the way is causing it.</div><div><br></div><div>Is the AP configured for all the VLANs? Is the switch port configured to pass the VLANs to the AP? Does the VLAN actually carry all the way back to the core? Is the device being profiled correctly by NAC? Is the AP in FortiNAC set to actually put devices of that profile on the correct VLAN? It's all a gamble, and you have to check everything! Like three times!</div><div><br></div><div>Don't get me wrong, it's still super fun and intriguing. Now that I've got it deployed across the entire network, I can finally go through and start cleaning up our IDFs by just unplugging and moving stuff without documenting exactly what device every single cable feeds. We can replace entire switches without one of those little placeholder blocks to make sure all the devices get plugged back into the same spot. I can spend less time configuring printers and phones for Helpdesk and more time actually documenting the fiber and figuring out why one switch is fed through 2 other IDFs when there's literally a direct path in a patch panel above.</div><div><br></div><div>You're still bound to get the issues here and there. A device won't be pulled from the MDM correctly and it'll get put on the workstation network instead of the tablet one. Or you'll accidentally plug your personal laptop into your dock and get instantly obliterated and banished to the dark depths of the isolation VLAN. This is such a common occurrence that I've coined a new term for it, which I'm sure someone else has beat me to - and that's "getting NAC'd" - which is just so much fun to say but also feels like a cross between British people being like "<i>oi bruv you got absolutely knackered out there innit</i>" and the old-internet "<i>get rekt.</i>" Both are exactly how I feel when I get NAC'd.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, this post has been a huge run-on of absolute nonsense and me trying to be funny. But these words bounce around in my head all day, and when I speak to Helpdesk about these things, I just get the thousand-yard stare of "bro, what is a default gateway?" - but then I talk to our cybersecurity guy and he's like "wait, you don't know how to configure the hypersegmented quasi-virtual LAN for layer 9?" and cry myself to sleep knowing that he could do my entire job but simply chooses not to.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So I dump these words on the internet, probably for 80% of the traffic to be from AI scrapers, and the remaining 20% to be from people who saw my LinkedIn profile, googled my name, read this article, and went "oh dear absolutely not" before scrolling to the next candidate. Maybe someday I'll be good enough to be in a Prime Reacts video, but I don't know Rust or Go, so probably not.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway,</div><div><br></div><div>Get NAC'd.</div>
