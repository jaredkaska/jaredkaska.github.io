                    <p>I feel like I've been a huge nerd for far too long to not have an actual website. 
                        I have made websites in the past, but never one for just myself.</p>
                    <p>It's currently about 11:30pm, and about an hour or so ago is when I decided to mash this thing together. 
                        It's not bad, I actually am a big fan of this super simple style. 
                        Thankfully it works out because I know the bare minimum of web development.</p>
                    <p>This website is written entirely in boring plain HTML and CSS, nothing more. 
                        Maybe at some point I can sprinkle in some JS if I'm feeling wild. 
                        And maybe at some point I can throw together an actual markdown editor for myself so
                        I don't have to literally code these blog posts by hand.</p>
                    <p>I'm actually pretty proud of how much I <i>didn't</i> have to look up
                        when making this website. I've actually retained more of my web development
                        skills than I thought I had.</p>
                    <p>I looked to the internet for exactly three things that I didn't know how to do
                        off the top of my head. I think those three things are kinda funny.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, I of course googled "how to center a div", which I know is basically a meme,
                        but I genuinely didn't remember how to. I feel like that should be easier, but I'm not
                        a developer.</p>
                    <p>The second thing I looked up was how to get those navigation buttons at the top
                        to be on one row rather than a list. It's literally "display:inline" - a great example
                        of how stupidly simple CSS can be.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the last thing I looked up was actually asking Copilot how to make the main
                        blog page to display the recent posts, but in a really simple way. Copilot's response
                        to this was basically, "if you want super simple, then hard code it in, idiot" which 
                        I also found pretty funny.</p>
                    <p>If you can't tell, I'm not exactly trying to win any awards with this website.
                        The reality is that I've just owned this domain for so long and never really had an 
                        actual personal website to go with it. So, for whatever reason, I finally decided to 
                        throw one together tonight. Again, I think it came out better than I expected and has 
                        gone by a lot faster than I thought it would.</p>
                    <p>I'll slowly try to improve it over time, and maybe one day it could help me 
                        land a job, but I'm not really looking for that right now, so I don't really 
                        care all that much. And besides, I definitely don't think I want a web design/development 
                        job.</p>
